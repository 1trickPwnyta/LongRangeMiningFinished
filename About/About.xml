How many times have you noticed that your miners are idle after finishing mining at a remote mining site discovered by the long-range mineral scanner and wondered how long they had been idle for? Maybe they had enough food to finish mining and come home, but not to camp out there indefinitely.

This mod shows a message at the top of the screen when your miners have finished mining at a remote site. You can also configure the mod to send you a letter on completion instead.
